# Mission to Mars

## **Overview of Project**

The purpose of this project was to build an APP to conduct web-scraping of MARS data and create an HTML page to show the results. Â 

## Results

We used Juypyter Notebook to scrape full resolution of Mars's Hemispheres alongside its and names from the site: https://marshemispheres.com/' and stored them into a dictionary that was then added to our APP so it was displayed on our HTML page. 

- Here you can see the dictionary created once the data was scraped:

- Here is the results of adding the scraped data to our HTML webpage:

## Adding Bootstrap 3 to the page

- Finally, we added some style to the page by stylizing the button to be smaller relative to the headline and also by making the **featured image** a circle to fit the theme of planetary data.

## Summary

We successfully created a page that aesthetically displays the data collected, is mobile-responsive and uses Bootstraps 3 components to style the webpage creating a user-friendly scraping tool.
