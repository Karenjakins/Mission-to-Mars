# Mission to Mars

## **Overview of Project**

The purpose of this project was to build an APP to conduct web-scrapping of MARS data using and create an HTML page to show the results of the data collected. Â 

## Results

We used Juypyter Notebook to scrape full resolution of Mars's Hemispheres alongside its and names from the site: https://marshemispheres.com/' and stored them into a dictionary that was then added to our APP so it was displayed on our HTML page. 

- Here you can see the dictonary created once the data was scraped:

- Here is the results of adding the scraped data to our HTML webpage:

## Adding Bootstrap 3 to the page

- Finally, we added some style to the page, stylizing the button to be smaller as relative to the headline and also by making the **featured image** a circle to fit the theme of planetary data.
